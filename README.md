## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Log Monitoring System** that reads logs from a file (`logs.txt`) and processes them using *Multi-threading* in Java. It is designed to efficiently handle large log files by utilizing multiple threads to improve performance.

---

### 🚀 Why This Project?

With the increasing number of **cyber threats** and **unauthorized access attempts**, log monitoring plays a crucial role in **enhancing security**. This system helps organizations:

- **Monitor login activities**
- **Detect suspicious login attempts**
- **Improve security** by identifying unusual patterns in login failures

---

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ **Efficient Log Analysis** - High-speed scanning of log files.
- ✅ **Real-time Alerts** - Detects security threats instantly.
- ✅ **Structured Logging** - Logs are well-organized for quick diagnosis.
- 🔍 **Real-time Log Monitoring** - Continuously scans logs for failed login attempts.
- ⚡ **Parallel Processing** - Uses **Multi-threading** to analyze large logs faster.
- 🚨 **Failed Login Detection** - Identifies multiple failed login attempts for security alerts.
- 📩 **Scalability** - Easily integrates with existing monitoring solutions.

## 📜 Example Log File (`logs.txt`)
```
[2025-03-10 10:15:30] User: Ahmed LOGIN SUCCESS
[2025-03-10 10:16:05] User: Sara FAILED LOGIN
[2025-03-10 10:16:35] User: Ali FAILED LOGIN
[2025-03-10 10:17:00] User: Sara FAILED LOGIN
[2025-03-10 10:17:20] User: Sara FAILED LOGIN

```


🚨 From the above logs, we can see that "Sara" has multiple failed login attempts, which could indicate a brute-force attack or unauthorized access attempt.
