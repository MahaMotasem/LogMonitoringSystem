## 📌 Overview
The **Advanced Log Monitoring System** is designed to **analyze and track login attempts in real-time** using **Java Multi-threading** and **Parallel Processing** for high-speed log file analysis. The system also leverages **Spring Batch** for efficient and scalable batch processing of large log files.

This project helps organizations **monitor login activities**, **detect suspicious login attempts**, and **improve security** by identifying unusual patterns in login failures.

### 🚀 Why This Project?
With the increasing number of **cyber threats** and **unauthorized access attempts**, log monitoring plays a crucial role in **enhancing security**.  
This system provides:

✅ **Real-time monitoring** of login attempts.  
✅ **Multi-threaded processing** for handling large log files efficiently.  
✅ **Batch processing** with **Spring Batch** for scalable log analysis.  
✅ **Suspicious login attempt detection** with alert capabilities.  
✅ **Future expansion** possibilities, such as **database integration, email notifications,** and a **web dashboard** for visualization.

## 📜 Example Log File (`logs.txt`)
```
[2025-03-10 10:15:30] User: Ahmed LOGIN SUCCESS  
[2025-03-10 10:16:05] User: Sara FAILED LOGIN  
[2025-03-10 10:16:35] User: Ali FAILED LOGIN  
[2025-03-10 10:17:00] User: Sara FAILED LOGIN  
[2025-03-10 10:17:20] User: Sara FAILED LOGIN
```
🚨 From the above logs, we can see that "Sara" has multiple failed login attempts, which could indicate a brute-force attack or unauthorized access attempt.
