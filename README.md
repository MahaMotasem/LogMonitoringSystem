# LogMonitoringSystem
# 🚀 Advanced Log Monitoring System

## 📝 Introduction  
In large-scale systems, monitoring **login logs** is crucial to detect **unauthorized access attempts** and improve system security.  
This project is designed to **analyze large log files efficiently** using **Multi-threading and Batch Processing**.

---

## 🎯 Project Idea  
🔹 Real-time analysis of **login logs** using **Java Multi-threading** for faster processing.  
🔹 Detecting **failed login attempts** and identifying possible **Brute Force Attacks**.  
🔹 Using **Spring Batch Processing** to handle **large datasets** effectively.  
🔹 Sending **real-time alerts** to administrators upon detecting suspicious activities.  

---

## ✨ Features  
✅ **High-speed log analysis** using **Parallel Processing**.  
✅ **Detection of failed login attempts & brute force attacks**.  
✅ **Efficient data handling** with **Batch Processing**.  
✅ **Integration with databases for long-term log storage**.  
✅ **Custom alerts & notifications** for security events.
