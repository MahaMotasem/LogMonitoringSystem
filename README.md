# 📌 Overview
This project is a **Log Monitoring System** that reads logs from a file (logs.txt) and processes them using *Multi-threading* in Java. It is designed to efficiently handle large log files by utilizing multiple threads to improve performance.

---

### 🚀 Why This Project?
With the increasing number of **cyber threats** and **unauthorized access attempts**, log monitoring plays a crucial role in **enhancing security**.  
This system helps organizations:
**monitor login activities**,
**detect suspicious login attempts**,
**improve security** by identifying unusual patterns in login failures.

---

## ⚙️ Features
#✅ **Efficient Log Analysis** -High-speed scanning of log files.  
#✅ **Real-time Alerts** -Detects security threats instantly. 
#✅ **Structured Logging**  – Logs are well-organized for quick diagnosis.
🔍 **Real-time Log Monitoring** – Continuously scans logs for failed login attempts.  
#⚡ **Parallel Processing** – Uses **Multi-threading** to analyze large logs faster.  
#🚨 **Failed Login Detection** – Identifies multiple failed login attempts for security alerts.   
#📩 **Scalability** – Easily integrates with existing monitoring solutions.

## 📜 Example Log File (`logs.txt`)
```
[2025-03-10 10:15:30] User: Ahmed LOGIN SUCCESS  
[2025-03-10 10:16:05] User: Sara FAILED LOGIN  
[2025-03-10 10:16:35] User: Ali FAILED LOGIN  
[2025-03-10 10:17:00] User: Sara FAILED LOGIN  
[2025-03-10 10:17:20] User: Sara FAILED LOGIN
```
🚨 From the above logs, we can see that "Sara" has multiple failed login attempts, which could indicate a brute-force attack or unauthorized access attempt.

## 🛠 Project Implementation Steps

-1️⃣ Requirements Analysis & Planning

Define the main objectives of the log monitoring system.

Identify key security threats and logging needs.

Choose the appropriate technologies

-2️⃣ Setting Up the Development Environment

Install Java (JDK 17+), Maven, and necessary dependencies.
Install NetBeans IDE.

Clone the GitHub repository.

-3️⃣ Implementing the Log Monitoring System

-🔄 Develop log processing services using Java multi-threading for efficiency.

-4️⃣ Log Analysis & Alert System

📊 Implement log parsing and filtering using Regex and data structures.

🚨 Detect failed login attempts and unauthorized access.

# Ensure logs.txt Exists
#- Inside the project folder, manually create a file named logs.txt and add some log data, for example:
  txt
  #[INFO] Application started
  #[WARNING] High memory usage detected
  #[ERROR] Unable to connect to database

-5️⃣ Deploy and Monitor

🚀 Build & Run the Project
